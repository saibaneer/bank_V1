# Basic Sample Bank Project

This project demonstrates a simple Bank in Solidity. While it works, it has a bug, which resets the deposit time each time a user depositis. This potentially renders inaccurate interests.

I essentially modified this project from Questbook, so it can be deployed on Hardhat.

Use "npm i" to install dependencies at the root of the folder.
